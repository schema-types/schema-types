# schema-types

**Status:** Alpha

This library provides runtime and compile-type type schema definition and validation. It is roughly usable, but still evolving.

### Goals

- As close to JSON Schema as possible (represent the type schema as pure data)
- High level of developer ergonomics (easy to define types, validate)
- Full modern TypeScript support (only target latest TypeScript, use all advanced features)
